  ## Description 
  Built a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

  ## Installation
  Installation of [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)
  *  Use ``npm install inquirer@8.2.4``

  Installation of [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
  * Use ``npm install``

  ## Useage 
  This application will be invoked by using the following command: ``node index.js`` or ``npm start``. Answer the prompt questions to add a manager, engineer, or intern and a index.html file will be generated in the dist folder. To remove the generated HTML file use the ``npm run reset`` command.
